## Introduction

Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of the other's various ships locations. The objective of the game is to guess the location of the ships each player hides on a plastic grid containing vertical and horizontal space coordinates. Players take turns calling out row and column coordinates (x,y) on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. The game board each player gets has two grids. One of the grids is used by the player to "hide" the location of his own ships, while the other grid is used to record the shots fired toward the opponent and to document whether those shots were hits or misses. The goal of the game is to sink all of the opponent's ships by correctly guessing their location on the grid.

## Research
### Battleship game
Battleship games introduce school kids to coordinates and grids in a hands-on kind of way; it helps them understand the relationship between rows and columns, as well as the relationship between an actual object or a sequence of events and how they are represented on a graph.
When playing any of the battleship games you need logic and reason, as well as memory; you must remember the shots you’ve taken, which square will be next and you must be able to formulate a mental picture of your opponent’s set up and keep that in mind as the game progresses.

All in all, it’s a complete brain workout and a great way to make learning fun, even in the classroom.
